Download mpv development files from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/
Get the mpv-dev-x86_64-*.7z file
Extract it somewhere (e.g., C:\mpv-dev)
You'll have:

- include/mpv/client.h
- libmpv.dll.a (import library)
- libmpv-2.dll (runtime DLL)

Then, once the app is built into an EXE, move libmpv-2.dll into the same folder
as the exe.

Next, run `C:\Qt\<version-number>\<mingw_64 probably>\bin\windeployqt.exe <theEXEname>`
from the directory your EXE is in to add all the needed Qt libraries into the same
directory and such.
